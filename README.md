# Spotify-Machine-Learning-Project

Two problems:
- A regression problem that aims to predict the popularity score of a song.
- A classification problem that aims to predict the top genre that a song belongs to.

A description of each problem, along with a detailed overview of the data, is available at:
- Regression Problem: https://www.kaggle.com/t/389309c5fb264ebea74a48a0bb9a3e87
- Classification Problem: https://www.kaggle.com/t/128af7e6ad61474b81f4820e5d5282df

This project covers Feature Engineering, standardisation. 
Baseline models are used:
- (Regression) Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression.
- (Classification) Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbours. 


Advanced models are used: RandomForest, SVM and XGBoost.

This was a collaborative effort with Ka Hou Ho (Andy), Cameron Brash, Stephanie Chung, Pongwutthisak Panupong (Aom) and Triratanapon Natkitha (Pin).
